Luna, once being taught how to use it a bit and getting over the learning curve, is simple to use and understand. The owner of the tool and his customer support is some of the best I've experienced with any software, period, and is the reason as to why I have been able to use and learn Luna so well. The only feature I would want out of Luna would be a MacOS port, but other than that, the software is great. Has been a pleasure to use."

The customer service was top tier, hands down the main reason i was able to learn so fast was how much help i received from the owner, I've never had this experience with any other software. Luna is an amazing tool to use, i recommend it to everyone that i know. I truly have no issues with it other than wishing it was compatible on mobile. 10/10 overall a great experience."
